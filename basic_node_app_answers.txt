1. A node module is a set of functions to include in an application.
2. The main difference between exports and module.exports is that module.exports can be reassigned to anything while reassignments of export will not be available outside of the the module.
3. Exports is recommended because it's a convenience variable that helps the coder write less code and working with its properties is safe and recommended
